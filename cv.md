3. Currently I'm working as a Head of Marketing Department, but I've got huge interest in web-development. I've started learning WEB about half a year ago. So far I'm rather good at HTML and CSS, I've also learned how to work with SASS/SCSS, GIT, Gulp, I've also learned responsive. I've passed an initial JavaScript course as well, and currently I'm doing a full course of JavaScript/React/Node.js at Coursera. I'm really interested in this sphere, and I love what I'm doing. Of course, there is still a lot to learn, but I'm not going to give up. I'm eager to participate in real projects already.

7. I have a higher aducation (specialist in foreign relations, two foreign languages: English and Spanish, + I've learned German at collegue). As for IT, I've passed an initial IT-course at Epam, and after that I began learning on-line on my own. I've passed 2 courses of Web-development so far (__*HTML/CSS/basic JavaScript*__), and now I'm doing a course of __*JS/React/Node.js*__.
8. Currently I have a **B2/C1** level. I've been learning English since kindergarden, so I'm rather good in it. I've also been practicing it for the last 6 years at work. Apart from English, I know Spanish and German.
