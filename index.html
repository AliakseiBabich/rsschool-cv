                <h3>Junior Web developer</h3>
                <p class="about-me">
                    Currently I'm working as a Head of Marketing Department, but I've got huge interest in web-development. I've started learning WEB about half a year ago. So far I'm rather good at HTML and CSS, I've also learned how to work with SASS/SCSS, GIT, Gulp, I've learned responsive as well. I've passed an initial JavaScript course as well, and currently I'm doing a full course of JavaScript/React/Node.js at Coursera. I'm really interested in this sphere, and I love what I'm doing. Of course, there is still a lot to learn, but I'm not going to give up. I'm eager to participate in real projects already.
