                <article class="about-me">
                    Currently I've finished a course of web-dev in RSSchool. I've started learning WEB about 9 months with HTML and CSS, but only when I entered RSS it became more serious. So far I'm rather good at working with HTML and CSS, I've also learned SASS/SCSS preprocessors, GIT, Gulp, adaptive/responsive design. Throughour the course I've also learned vanilla JavaScript, worked with a couple of libraries, such as axious and lodash. I've now inrolled into a React course.
